# Loan-Approval-Detection
## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan should be approved based on various applicant features. The dataset contains demographic, financial, and employment information of loan applicants. The objective is to help financial institutions **automate** and **improve** the loan approval process using **data-driven insights**.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied to clean and prepare the data:

1. Handled missing values  
2. Encoded categorical variables using **label encoding**  
3. Scaled numerical features where appropriate  
4. Split data into **training** and **testing** sets

## 📈 Data Visualization

Data visualization was used to explore and understand the dataset:

1. Explored the distribution of key features (e.g., *applicant income*, *loan amount*)  
2. Analyzed correlations and relationships between variables  
3. Used **Matplotlib** to display:
   - Histograms  
   - Boxplots  
   - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

## 🤖 Model Implementation

Implemented and compared the following machine learning models:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
2. **Naive Bayes**  
3. **Random Forest Classifier**  
4. **Decision Tree Classifier**  

Model performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision & Recall  
- Confusion Matrix
